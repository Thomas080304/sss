Cell Templates
==============

Wijmo interops for popular frameworks allow you to define custom content for
grid cells declaratively, by using the frameworks' own template markup.

Such templates may include arbitrary components and HTML elements, with
property and event bindings. All types of grid cells can be defined using
templates (data cells, header cells, editors, etc).

This sample shows a grid with the templates for all types of the cells.
The templates can be dynamically enabled or disabled by toggling the
checkboxes.
