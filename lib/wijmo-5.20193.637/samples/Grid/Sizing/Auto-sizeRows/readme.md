Auto-Size Rows
==============

This grid automatically resizes rows to fit their content.

It does this by setting the **autoRowHeights** property to true.

Row heights are updated when the grid is bound, when cells are edited,
and when columns are resized.

To see how this works, try resizing the "Countries" column or editing
some cells in that column.

The **autoRowHeights** property is especially useful in grids that 
have columns with wrapping text (**wordWrap** = true).
