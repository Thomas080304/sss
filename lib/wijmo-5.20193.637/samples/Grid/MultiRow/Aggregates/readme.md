Aggregates
==========

The **MultiRow** control supports **CollectionView**-based grouping just like **FlexGrid**.

When showing grouped data, the control adds group header rows that can be used to
collapse and expand the groups and also to display aggregate statistics for the groups.

To ensure aggregates are visible on the group header rows, set the **multiRowGroupHeaders**
property to true.
