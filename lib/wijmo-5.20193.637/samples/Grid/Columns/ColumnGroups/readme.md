Column Groups
=============

This sample shows how you can create column groups by initializing the grid's
**columnGroups** collection with an array of hierarchical elements where 
columns may have a columns property containing child columns.

The column groups may be collapsible and configured to show any of the child
columns when the group is collapsed.

You can use CSS to animate the column groups as they expand or collapse.
