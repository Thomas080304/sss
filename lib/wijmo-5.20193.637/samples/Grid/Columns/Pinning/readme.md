Pinning Columns
===============

The FlexGrid's **allowPinning** property allows users to pin columns to the left-hand side
of the grid so they remain visible as the user scrolls the grid horizontally. 

Setting **allowPinning** to true causes the grid to add pin icons to the column header cells.
Clicking the pins freezes (or unfreezes) the columns.
