FlexGridSearch
==============

The **FlexGridSearch** control provides a simple UI for performing full-text searches
on **FlexGrid** controls. 

It filters the data and highlights matches on the grid as you type.

The same **FlexGrid** control can be filtered by the **FlexGridSearch** control and 
**FlexGridFilter** component at the same time.
