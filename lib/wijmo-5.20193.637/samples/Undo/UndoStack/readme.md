UndoStack
=========

The __UndoStack__ class lets you add and undo/redo stack to a page, a form, or any element.

It tracks changes to regular HTML input elements as well as most Wijmo controls, handles
the undo/redo keys automatically, and provides commands for executing undo and redo actions
programmatically.
