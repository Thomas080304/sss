Edit and Persist Views
======================

Views in the **PivotEngine** are defined by the **viewDefinition** property.

You can use the engine's **viewDefinition** property to persist views as application settings.

This sample shows how you can select pre-defined views, edit the current view with the **PivotPanel**,
and save views to be loaded later.
