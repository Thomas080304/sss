TemplateLiterals
================

Template Literals are a great JavaScript feature introduced in ES2015/ES6.

They allow you to build multiline strings with interpolated values, and make
it easy to handle single and double quotes embedded in your strings.

This sample shows how you can use Wijmo's **glbz** tag function to add
formatting and internationalization to template literals.
