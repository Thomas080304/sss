CollectionViewNavigator
=======================

The **CollectionViewNavigator** control allows users to navigate the items or pages in
**CollectionView** components.

To use it, set the navigator's **cv** property to the **CollectionView** instance it 
should control.

To navigate by page, set the **byPage** property to true. To navigate by item, set it
to **false**.

You can customize the display of the current item/page by setting the navigator's
**headerFormat** property.
