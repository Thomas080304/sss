GanttRepeat
===========

Gantt charts illustrate project schedules. They show the start and finish dates of each task and typically add information such as the completion state of each task and dependencies between tasks.

This sample shows how you can use the **FlexChart** to create a Gantt chart with repeating tasks.

It does this by adding data items with the same (numeric) "X" value.

The Y axis has an itemFormatter that replaces the bound X values (index) with the task names.
