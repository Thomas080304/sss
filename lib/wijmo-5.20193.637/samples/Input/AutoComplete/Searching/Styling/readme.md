AutoComplete Styling Matches
============================

When searching with the __AutoComplete__, matching strings are highlighted in bold by default.

The **wj-state-match** is applied to matching spans in the drop-down list.

If you want to use a different style to highlight matches, use CSS to customize the rules
applied to the **wj-state-match** class.
