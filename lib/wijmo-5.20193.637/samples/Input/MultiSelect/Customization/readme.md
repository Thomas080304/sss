MultiSelect with customized items
=================================

The **MultiSelect** allows you to customize the display of the items in the drop-down list. This sample applies custom HTML to each item in the drop-down, providing more information to the end user and the selection. The first **input** element with **type="checkbox"** in the item content will be used to change a checked state of the item.
